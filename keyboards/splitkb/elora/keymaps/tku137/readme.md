### Base layer

This keymap uses a QWERTY base layer and features setting Colemak-DH as the default base layer as well.

### Symbols layer

The symbols layer relies on the [EurKEY](https://eurkey.steffen.bruentjen.eu) system keymap to be installed. It uses some custom keycodes to type the â‚¬ symbol and such.

### Navigation layer

The navigation layer has modifiers on the right with an additional Hyper key half and almost default Elora's navigation layer. The main difference is the use of a `MicMute` key. This key is triggering `<Hyper-M>`, which is set as the hotkey in the app [MuteKey](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mutekey/id1509590766).

### Function layer

This also has the modifiers on the right for consistency along the additional Hyper modifier. It has an F-Key cluster around the home-row on the left and some system keys like cpas-lock on the top right keys. It also has a [KeyCast](https://github.com/keycastr/keycastr) key using its default hotkey. Other than that, it has a LaunchPad and Mission Control key on the outermost, top thumb keys. For convenience while flashing, a boot key is placed in the top left.

### Adjust layer

The adjust layer uses some keyboard specific settings on the right. The right has buttons for switching the default base layer, adjusting the screen brigheness (if supported) and setting the target WPM. The left has buttons to save and load the default RGB setting and controls to modify every aspect of the RGB underglow.

## Gaming layers

### Base layer

The base gaming layer has WASD in a comfortable place and common modifiers to the right. Due to the shifted W and S keys, X is moved to the top row. Left we have common keys for Journal, Inventory and Map. Otherwise letters are shifted one column to the right compared to QWERTY. Top left is the common quick-save key F5.

### Extended layer

The extended gaming layer has every key that is not in the base gaming layer. It has F1-F5 in the top row, some navigation keys in the left most row, and numbers 6 and 7 in case they are needed.
