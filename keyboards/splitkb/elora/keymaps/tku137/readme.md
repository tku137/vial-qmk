# tku137's keymap for Elora

![kle-render herokuapp com-2](https://github.com/tku137/vial-qmk/assets/3052212/fcf3b045-8f1f-47f0-939a-179f06abf9ca)

## Base layer

This keymap uses Elora's default QWERTY layout as the base layer.

## Symbols layer

The symbols layer relies on the [EurKEY](https://eurkey.steffen.bruentjen.eu) system keymap to be installed. It uses some custom keycodes to type the € symbol and such.

## Navigation layer

The navigation layer has modifiers on the right with an additional Hyper key half and almost default Elora's navigation layer. The main difference is the use of a `MicMute` key. This key is triggering `<Hyper-M>`, which is set as the hotkey in the app [MuteKey](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mutekey/id1509590766).

## Function layer

This also has the modifiers on the right for consistency along the additional Hyper modifier. It has an F-Key cluster around the home-row on the left and some system keys like cpas-lock on the top right keys. It also has a [KeyCast](https://github.com/keycastr/keycastr) key using its default hotkey. Other than that, it has a LaunchPad and Mission Control key on the outermost, top thumb keys. For convenience while flashing, a boot key is placed in the top left.

## Adjust leyer

The adjust layer uses some keyboard specific settings on the right and has been extended by brightness keys on the left.
